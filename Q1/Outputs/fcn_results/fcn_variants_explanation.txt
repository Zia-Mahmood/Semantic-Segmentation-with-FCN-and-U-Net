# Explanation of FCN Variants

## Differences between FCN-32s, FCN-16s, and FCN-8s

1. FCN-32s:
   - Uses only the final feature map from VGG (pool5)
   - Directly upsamples the prediction by 32x to match the input size
   - Simplest architecture but results in coarse predictions due to large stride

2. FCN-16s:
   - Combines predictions from pool4 (16x downsampled) and pool5 (32x downsampled)
   - First upsamples pool5 predictions by 2x, then adds pool4 predictions
   - Finally upsamples the combined result by 16x
   - Produces finer predictions than FCN-32s by incorporating intermediate features

3. FCN-8s:
   - Combines predictions from pool3 (8x downsampled), pool4 (16x downsampled), and pool5 (32x downsampled)
   - First upsamples pool5 predictions by 2x, then adds pool4 predictions
   - Then upsamples the result by 2x again and adds pool3 predictions
   - Finally upsamples the combined result by 8x
   - Produces the finest predictions among the three variants by incorporating more intermediate features

## Performance Comparison

### FCN Variants with Frozen Backbone

FCN-32s (Frozen): Test mIoU = 0.4875
FCN-16s (Frozen): Test mIoU = 0.5018
FCN-8s (Frozen): Test mIoU = 0.5112

### FCN Variants with Fine-tuned Backbone

FCN-32s (Fine-tuned): Test mIoU = 0.5581
FCN-16s (Fine-tuned): Test mIoU = 0.6487
FCN-8s (Fine-tuned): Test mIoU = 0.6530

## Effect of Fine-tuning the Backbone

1. FCN-32s: Fine-tuning improves performance by 0.0706 mIoU (14.48%)
2. FCN-16s: Fine-tuning improves performance by 0.1469 mIoU (29.27%)
3. FCN-8s: Fine-tuning improves performance by 0.1418 mIoU (27.74%)

### Analysis

1. Skip Connections Impact: FCN-8s consistently outperforms FCN-16s and FCN-32s, demonstrating the benefit of incorporating features from earlier layers for preserving spatial details.

2. Fine-tuning Impact: Fine-tuning the backbone generally improves performance across all variants, as the backbone can adapt to the specific dataset rather than using generic ImageNet features.

3. Qualitative Analysis: Visually, FCN-8s typically produces segmentation masks with sharper boundaries and better preservation of fine details compared to the other variants.
